# NLP
Found above is the winning system for UC Santa Cruz's Natural Language Processing competition. The task was to create a question and answer system using machine learning and NLP principles based in the python written NLTK library. The competition composed of both undergraduates and graduate students. Our team not only won, but smashed the schools record for F-measure validity which has still not been bested.
